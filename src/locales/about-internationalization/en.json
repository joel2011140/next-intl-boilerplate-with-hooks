  "intro": "Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and developing a software application, product, or content to make it adaptable to various languages, regions, and cultures without requiring engineering changes. It's a foundational step that comes before localization (l10n). Think of i18n as building a flexible structure with placeholders for text, dates, and currencies, ensuring that the technical backbone of your product is ready for a global audience. By implementing i18n from the start, companies can significantly reduce costs, accelerate time-to-market for new locales, and provide a seamless, culturally relevant experience for users worldwide."
